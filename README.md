### Split
A simple tool allowing to divide a PDF file into several files ... 
There are various tools of this kind very often paying, see not compatible RGPD, 
so I made this little free tool, simple, without tracker, just a split pdf file.

### How To Run 
Launch WindowsPdfSplitter.exe
  - Select PDF file location
  - Select the backup directory
  - Run Split
  
 Reset button clean all form
